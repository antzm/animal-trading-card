			<p class="txtBrief">Merfy is a very friendly dog with anyone he meets. He likes playing with kids and as strange as it may seem, he also enjoys playing with kittens and obviously with puppies. He was found as an abandoned puppy with his eyes still closed and was raised next to a kitten. Thatâ€™s why he grew up to become so friendly with kittens and also with every person he meets.</p>
